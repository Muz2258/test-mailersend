								Fifteen years after getting his MBA, Raj Raghunathan spent some time
								with his old classmates. He noticed that though they'd all done
								well, there didn't appear to be much correlation between their
								academic success and career success. What Raj found even more
								curious was the even smaller correlation between career success and
								what he calls life success. The greater the career success, the more
								unhappy, out of shape, harried and distracted his friends were.
							</p>
							<p>
								If intelligence helps with decision-making, smart people should
								naturally make better life choices. So why are so many of the
								smartest, brightest, most successful people profoundly unhappy? Raj
								set out to find an answer to this problem, and extensively
								researched happiness not just of students and business people, but
								also stay-at-home-parents, lawyers, and artists, among others.
							</p>
							<p>
								If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Happy? takes readers on a fun and
								meaningful tour of the best research available on how some of the
								very determinants of success may also come to deflate happiness.
								Raghunathan explores the seven most common inclinations that
								successful people need to overcome, and the seven habits they should
								adopt instead. Among his surprising findings...
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The correlation between wealth and happiness is much smaller
									than you'd expect it to be
								</li>
								<li>
									Generosity is not only a key to happiness, but a determining
									factor of long term success
								</li>
								<li>
									Appreciating uncertainty, rather than seeking full control of
									outcomes, is necessary for happiness
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Happy? will give you a powerful
								new perspective on your work, personal goals and relationships,
								whether you're already successful or just starting out.

							<p>If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed.</p>
							<p>
								On May 17, 2014, Admiral William H. McRaven addressed the graduating
								class of the University of Texas at Austin on their Commencement
								day. Taking inspiration from the university's slogan, "What starts
								here changes the world," he shared the ten principles he learned
								during Navy Seal training that helped him overcome challenges not
								only in his training and long Naval career, but also throughout his
								life; and he explained how anyone can use these basic lessons to
								change themselves-and the world-for the better.
							</p>
							<p>
								Admiral McRaven's original speech went viral with over 10 million
								views. Building on the core tenets laid out in his speech, McRaven
								now recounts tales from his own life and from those of people he
								encountered during his military service who dealt with hardship and
								made tough decisions with determination, compassion, honor, and
								courage. Told with great humility and optimism, this timeless book
								provides simple wisdom, practical advice, and words of encouragement
								that will inspire readers to achieve more, even in life's darkest
								moments.

								No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for
								improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading
								experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will
								teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and
								master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't
								you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again
								and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have
								the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your
								goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a
								proven system that can take you to new heights.
							</p>
							<p>
								Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple
								behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here,
								he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and
								neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good
								habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers
								will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold
								medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving
								physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small
								habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.
							</p>
							<p>Learn how to:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);</li>
								<li>overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;</li>
								<li>design your environment to make success easier;</li>
								<li>get back on track when you fall off course;</li>
							</ul>
							<p>...and much more.</p>
							<p>
								Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and
								success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform
								your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship,
								an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an
								individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress,
								or achieve any other goal.

								For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare -- poverty, prejudice,
								and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But
								through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins
								transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no
								future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top
								endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite
								training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air
								Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events,
								inspiring Outside magazine to name him
								<q>The Fittest (Real) Man in America.</q>
							</p>
							<p>
								In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals
								that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls
								this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can
								follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full
								potential.

								Two decades ago, Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus

								Gray's work has helped countless readers improve and even save their

								time to move beyond Mars and Venus, toward a new relationship model
								for modern couples.
							</p>
							<p>
								Today, men and women are no longer trapped by rigid societal roles.
								Now more than ever, we have the freedom to be our authentic selves.
								Women can access their masculine side, and men can embrace their
								feminine side. This new freedom is a good thing, but it also brings
								new challenges.
							</p>
							<p>
								Men and women still need the right tools and skills to help build
								stronger relation- ships. While previous generations sought
								<q>role mate</q> relationships, based on the more rigid gender roles
								of the time, today's couples need a new kind of relationship: a
								<q>soul mate</q> relationship. These more emotionally satisfying
								relationships require a deeper understanding of our partners'
								individual needs. In Beyond Mars and Venus, Gray teaches you how to
								strengthen your bond and grow in love together, so you and your
								loved one can meet each other's needs in the best way possible,
								bringing you lasting happiness and a fulfilling partnership.
